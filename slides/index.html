<a href=https://teaching.wence.uk/comp2221/code/lectures/2021-22/Lec03.hs>code (finishing session 3)</a></p><p>We didn&rsquo;t see any slides this time and instead worked our way
through the definitions of some polymorphic functions. The main
focus was on figuring out how we might be able to write <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function>total
functions</a> which are
functions which produce valid results for all possible inputs. To do
so, we introduced the
<a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Maybe><code>Maybe</code></a>
data type, which models a computation that may fail.</p><p>We then saw that to constructively work with <code>Maybe</code> types we are
likely going to need a way to transform values that live &ldquo;inside&rdquo;
<code>Maybe</code>s and introduced a function <code>applyInsideMaybe</code> whose type signature bore a
striking resemblance to that of
<a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:map><code>map</code></a>,
which is approximately where we will start next time.</p></li><li><p>2022-01-24:

<a href=https://teaching.wence.uk/comp2221/code/lectures/2021-22/Lec04.hs>code</a></p><p>We talked a little bit about Haskell type classes and how they are
used to implement constrained generic programming: that is writing
generic functions that can specify interfaces that the arguments
should satisfy.</p><p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_%28computer_science%29>wikipedia
page</a>
has a nice overview as usual on polymorphism. The classic work on
subtyping is from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov>Barbara
Liskov</a> from 1987. The
method that Haskell uses for constrained (ad-hoc) polymorphism based
on type classes was introduced by <a href=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/>Phil
Wadler</a> and <a href=https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~sblott/>Stephen
Blott</a> in <a href=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/type-classes.html#class><em>How to make
ad-hoc polymorphism less ad
hoc</em></a>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6COvD8oynmI">Here&rsquo;s a video</a> of
Simon Peyton Jones giving an introductory talk on type classes and
their implementation in GHC.</p><p>We implemented our own linked list type and and discussed pattern
matching a bit more.</p></li><li><p>2022-01-28:

method for writing recursive functions. We have effectively covered
the slides up to lecture 5 (as uploaded on blackboard), we just
started hinting at folds in the last part of the session 5 slides.</p><p>We saw that a number of &ldquo;library&rdquo; functions on lists follow the same
pattern, and we sketched a higher order function that captures this
pattern.</p><p>I showed a way to find functions in the Haskell standard
library (and packages) if you know the type by using
<a href=https://hoogle.haskell.org>hoogle</a>.</p></li><li><p>2022-01-31:

no code today</p><p>We introduced, following on from looking for patterns, <code>foldr</code> and
<code>foldl</code> and saw how they can be seen on lists as rebuilding the
structure with a new binary operator (instead of <code>(:)</code>) and initial
element (instead of <code>[]</code>).</p><p>We then also looked at two &ldquo;principled&rdquo; type classes, namely
<a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Functor><code>Functor</code></a>
for mappable types, and
<a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#t:Foldable><code>Foldable</code></a>,
for foldable types.</p><p>The type classes are termed &ldquo;principled&rdquo; because their
implementations are expected to satisfy certain equational laws that
mathematically capture certain properties that an implementation
must obey so that it behaves &ldquo;as expected&rdquo;. We saw the <code>Functor</code>
laws, but not the <code>Foldable</code> laws (which need more time than we have
here). Note that although I often ask you to implement <code>Functor</code> and
<code>Foldable</code> instances, GHC can actually derive them for you if you
add</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#272822;background-color:#fafafa><code class=language-hs data-lang=hs><span style=color:#75715e>{-# LANGUAGE DeriveFunctor #-}</span>

for the <code>Maybe</code>, <code>BinaryTree</code>, and <code>RoseTree</code> data types we&rsquo;d seen.
Then we talked about how Haskell evaluations expression graphs and
how we can do strict (eager) evaluation with <code>($!)</code>. I rushed
through the last few slides a little bit so will go over them again
briefly on Monday to wrap up the lazy evaluation aspects and then
talk about data encapsulation and compile-time safe APIs.</p></li><li><p>2022-02-07:

simple folds in terms of performance (particularly between <code>foldl</code>
and <code>foldl'</code>), though noted for this simple example that GHC does a
good job determining that it can evaluate things strictly. For more
details on this, see the <a href=https://wiki.haskell.org/Performance/Strictness>haskell
wiki</a>.</p><p>I then talked about the design of APIs and &ldquo;type-driven design&rdquo;, and
how a rich type system can help us in the design of libraries that
are in some sense impossible to misuse.</p><p>This style of interface is becoming more popular because it
pushes a bunch of the complexity of keeping track of invariants onto
the type system and compiler (rather than the programmer&rsquo;s brain).</p><p>In Haskell-ese an often quoted mantra is to <a href=https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/making-illegal-states-unrepresentable/>&ldquo;make illegal states
unrepresentable&rdquo;</a>.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested in this kind of stuff, here are some starting
points for further reading</p><ul><li><a href=https://lexi-lambda.github.io>Alexis King</a> has a nice article on
the idea of <a href=https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/>parsing rather than
validating</a></li><li>The <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/>Rust</a> community has really got on
board with <a href=http://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/>type state
patterns</a></li><li><a href=https://mobile.twitter.com/banjotragedy>Matt Noonan</a> shows how
Haskell can provide enough dependent types to encode quite
complicated invariants (such as the <code>mergeBy</code> example in the
lecture) <a href=https://kataskeue.com/gdp.pdf>in the type system</a>.</li><li>If you&rsquo;re interested in formal methods and proof systems, <a href=https://dependenttyp.es/>Talia

forced us to introduce the concept of actions. I showed some
information about <code>do</code> notation for peeking inside them, and how
conceptually, doing I/O can be seen as taking the state of the
universe and producing a new state. The main takeaway is that we
have to wrap up impure &ldquo;actions&rdquo; so that we don&rsquo;t break referential
transparency in the language.</p><p>I then summarised the course and talked a little about what I think
the important bits are.</p><p>There were some questions about pointers to bigger programs in
Haskell. For self-contained things, you might look at the Imperial
<a href=http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/ajf/haskell-tests/>January Haskell tests</a>.
For bigger things you might start at the <a href=https://wiki.haskell.org/Applications_and_libraries>Haskell
wiki</a>. One
thing to note is that lots of the libraries in the wild will use
more advanced features than we saw in the course (but maybe that&rsquo;s
helpful).</p><p>The <a href=#further-resources>resources</a> section of the
front page also has some pointers.</p><p>Next term there will be a revision lecture scheduled, but this was
my last term in Durham, so it will come from someone else. Look out
